# Contributing to BorgScale

Thank you for your interest in contributing to BorgScale!

## Quick Start

### Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/borgscale.git
cd borgscale

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/karanhudia/borgscale.git
```

### Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Make Changes

- Follow the existing code style
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed
- Install git hooks with `pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type pre-push`

### Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run repository hooks
pre-commit run --all-files

# Backend tests
pytest

# Frontend type checking
cd frontend && npm run typecheck

# Start dev environment (hot reload)
./scripts/dev.sh

# Or test the full production build
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Submit a Pull Request

1. Push your changes to your fork
2. Open a pull request against `main`
3. Describe your changes clearly
4. Link any related issues

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

**Backend (Python)**
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints where applicable
- Add docstrings for functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and testable

**Frontend (TypeScript/React)**
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow Material-UI patterns
- Keep components small and reusable
- Use hooks for state management

### Testing

All contributions should include appropriate tests:

**Unit Tests**
- Test individual functions and components
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for high code coverage

**Integration Tests**
- Test API endpoints
- Test database operations
- Test service interactions

Run tests before submitting:
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### Documentation

Update documentation when:
- Adding new features
- Changing existing behavior
- Fixing bugs that affect usage
- Adding new configuration options

Documentation files are in the `docs/` directory.

## Development Setup

See the full [Development Guide](development.md) for detailed instructions. Quick summary:

```bash
# Start dev environment (backend in Docker, frontend local, both hot-reload)
./scripts/dev.sh
```

- Frontend: [http://localhost:7879](http://localhost:7879)
- Dev backend: `http://localhost:DEV_PORT` (default `8083`, set in `.env`)

```bash
# Test the production build
docker-compose up -d --build
```

- Production: `http://localhost:PORT` (default `8082`, set in `.env`)

Both can run simultaneously — they use separate container names and ports.
