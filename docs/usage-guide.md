# Usage Guide: Creating Backups

This guide shows you how to create backups using BorgScale. There are two main methods:

1. **Local Backups** - Backup to storage attached to your Docker host (USB drives, NAS mounts, etc.)
2. **SSH/Remote Backups** - Backup to remote servers via SSH

Both methods follow the same workflow, with one key difference: **SSH backups require SSH key setup**.

## Understanding Backup Types

### Local Backups

**What is it?**
Stores backup data on storage directly accessible to your Docker host machine.

**Best for:**
- USB external drives
- Network-attached storage (NAS) mounted via NFS/CIFS
- Additional internal drives
- Same-machine backups

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Simple setup (no SSH keys needed)
- ✅ Faster backup speeds (no network overhead)
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ Lower latency

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ No off-site protection (if your machine fails, backups may be lost)
- ❌ Requires physical storage

---

### SSH/Remote Backups

**What is it?**
Stores backup data on a remote server accessible via SSH.

**Best for:**
- Remote VPS/cloud servers
- Off-site backup targets (Raspberry Pi at another location)
- Storage servers without NFS/CIFS
- Professional/enterprise setups

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Off-site protection (survives local disasters)
- ✅ No need to mount network drives
- ✅ Works across the internet
- ✅ Industry-standard secure protocol

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Requires SSH key setup
- ❌ Slower over internet connections
- ❌ Requires remote server access

---

## Prerequisites

Before creating backups, ensure:

1. **BorgScale is running**: `http://localhost:8081`
2. **You're logged in** (default: `admin` / `admin123`)
3. **Container has proper permissions**: Set `PUID`/`PGID` if needed (see [Troubleshooting > Permission Issues](https://github.com/karanhudia/borgscale#permission-issues))

---

## Method 1: Local Backups (Recommended for Beginners)

### What You'll Need

- A storage location on your Docker host machine
- The path to that storage (e.g., `/mnt/usb-drive`, `/mnt/nas`)

### Understanding Volume Mounts

Container paths have no magic — they contain exactly what you mounted in your `docker-compose.yml`. You can name them anything that makes sense to you.

For example, if you have three drives on one machine:
```yaml
volumes:
  - /mnt/photos:/photos:rw
  - /mnt/nas:/nas:rw
  - /mnt/external:/external:rw
environment:
  - LOCAL_MOUNT_POINTS=/photos,/nas,/external
```

Inside borgscale, `/photos` is your photos drive, `/nas` is your NAS, `/external` is your external drive. `LOCAL_MOUNT_POINTS` tells borgscale about all of them so the file browser picks them up.

Use these container paths when creating repositories or selecting source paths in the UI.

---

### Step 1: Ensure Storage is Accessible

**Good news:** You don't need to create directories manually! Borg automatically creates the repository directory when you initialize it.

**What you DO need:**
- Storage attached to your Docker host (USB drive, NAS mount, etc.)
- Your Docker user has write permissions to the **parent directory**

**Examples of parent directories:**
- `/mnt/usb-drive/` - For external drives (Linux/Pi)
- `/mnt/nas/` - For NAS mounts
- `/home/user/backups/` - For home directory (Linux)
- `~/backups/` - For home directory (shorthand)
- `/Volumes/MyExternalDrive/` - For external drives (macOS)

**Setting permissions (if needed):**

```bash
# Linux/Raspberry Pi - Make sure you own the parent directory
sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) /mnt/usb-drive

# Check permissions
ls -la /mnt/usb-drive
```

**Tip:** Ensure `PUID`/`PGID` in docker-compose matches your user ID. See [Troubleshooting > Permission Issues](https://github.com/karanhudia/borgscale#permission-issues).

---

### Step 2: Create a Repository in BorgScale

A **repository** is where Borg stores your encrypted backup data.

1. **Navigate to Repositories**
   Click **"Repositories"** in the sidebar

2. **Click "Create Repository"**

3. **Fill in Repository Details:**

   | Field | Example Value | Description |
   |-------|---------------|-------------|
   | **Repository Name** | `my-laptop-backup` | Friendly name for identification |
   | **Repository Path** | `/local/mnt/usb-drive/borg-backups/laptop` | Path **inside the container** (use `/local/` prefix!) |
   | **Encryption Mode** | `repokey-blake2` | Recommended for best security |
   | **Passphrase** | `your-strong-password-123` | **Store this safely!** You cannot recover data without it. |

   **Path Translation Examples:**

   | Host Path | Container Path (use this in UI) |
   |-----------|----------------------------------|
   | `/mnt/usb-drive/borg-backups/laptop` | `/local/mnt/usb-drive/borg-backups/laptop` |
   | `/mnt/nas/backups/myrepo` | `/local/mnt/nas/backups/myrepo` |
   | `/home/user/backups/data` | `/local/home/user/backups/data` |
   | `~/backups/borg-repos/myrepo` | `/local/home/<username>/backups/borg-repos/myrepo` |

4. **Configure Compression (Optional)**
   - **Recommended**: `lz4` (fast) or `zstd,3` (balanced)
   - Leave default if unsure

5. **Add Source Paths**
   Click **"Add Source Path"** and specify what to backup:

   **Examples:**
   - `/local/home/user/Documents` - Backup Documents folder
   - `/local/var/www` - Backup web server files
   - `/local/etc` - Backup configuration files

   **⚠️ Important:** Use `/local/` prefix for paths inside the container!

6. **Review and Create**
   - Check the auto-generated command preview
   - Click **"Create Repository"**

7. **Success!**
   You'll see your repository listed with status "Active"

---

### Step 3: Run Your First Backup

Now that your repository is created, let's create your first backup (called an "archive" in Borg).

1. **Navigate to Backup Tab**
   Click **"Backup"** in the sidebar

2. **Select Repository**
   Choose `my-laptop-backup` from the dropdown

3. **Optional: Add Exclude Patterns**
   Exclude files you don't want to backup:
   ```
   **/.git
   **/node_modules
   **/__pycache__
   **/.DS_Store
   **/Thumbs.db
   ```

4. **Click "Start Backup"**

5. **Watch Progress in Real-Time:**
   - Current file being processed
   - Files processed count
   - Original size vs. compressed size
   - Deduplicated size (space saved!)
   - Speed and ETA

6. **Completion**
   Once finished, you'll see:
   - Total files processed
   - Original size → Compressed → Deduplicated
   - Duration and average speed
   - Backup archive name (e.g., `2025-10-22T10-30-45`)

**🎉 Congratulations!** Your first local backup is complete.

---

### Customizing Local Mount for Security

**For security-conscious deployments, mount only the directories you need** — both the source data and the backup destination, with appropriate permissions.

**Edit `docker-compose.yml`:**

```yaml
volumes:
  # Recommended: Mount specific directories with appropriate permissions

  # Option 1: Separate source (read-only) and destination (read-write)
  - /home/user/documents:/source:ro           # What to backup (read-only)
  - /mnt/backup-drive:/destination:rw         # Where to store backups (read-write)

  # Option 2: Mount only user directories (Linux)
  - /home:/local:rw

  # Option 3: Mount only user directories (macOS)
  - /Users:/local:rw

  # Option 4: Mount only backup storage location
  - /mnt/nas:/local:rw

  # Option 5: Mount only specific backup directory
  - /mnt/backup-storage:/local:rw
```

Or use the `LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH` environment variable in `.env`:
```bash
# Only mount what you need for backups
LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH=/home

# Other examples:
# LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH=/Users                    # macOS user directories
# LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH=/mnt/backup-storage       # Only backup storage
# LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH=/home/user/backups        # Specific directory
```

**Important**: After customizing mounts, adjust your repository paths accordingly:
- With `/home:/local:rw` → Use `/local/username/backups/repo`
- With `/mnt/nas:/local:rw` → Use `/local/borg-repos/repo`
- With `/home/user/documents:/source:ro` → Use `/source` for backup source

---

## Method 2: SSH/Remote Backups

### What You'll Need

- A remote server with:
  - SSH access (username and IP/hostname)
  - Borg installed (`sudo apt install borgbackup` or equivalent)
  - A directory for backups
- SSH key pair (we'll generate this in the UI)

---

### Step 1: Generate or Import SSH Key

SSH keys authenticate your connection to the remote server without passwords.

1. **Navigate to SSH Keys**
   Click **"SSH Keys"** in the sidebar

2. **Generate New Key**
   Click **"Generate Key Pair"**

   | Field | Example | Description |
   |-------|---------|-------------|
   | **Key Name** | `backup-server-key` | Friendly identifier |
   | **Key Type** | `ed25519` | Recommended (secure & fast) |
   | **Comment** | `borgscale@myhost` | Optional label |

3. **Download Private Key** (Optional)
   - Click **"Download Private Key"** to save a backup
   - Store safely (this is your authentication credential!)

4. **Copy Public Key**
   Click **"Copy Public Key"** - you'll need this for the next step

---

### Step 2: Deploy Public Key to Remote Server

The remote server needs your public key to allow connections.

**Option A: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)**

1. In the SSH Keys list, click **"Deploy"** next to your key

2. Fill in deployment details:

   | Field | Example | Description |
   |-------|---------|-------------|
   | **Hostname** | `192.168.1.100` or `backup.example.com` | IP or domain of remote server |
   | **Port** | `22` | SSH port (usually 22) |
   | **Username** | `backupuser` | SSH username on remote server |
   | **Password** | `server-password` | Temporary (only for deployment) |

3. Click **"Deploy Key"**
   The UI will automatically add your public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote server.

4. **Success!**
   You can now use this key for SSH repositories.

**Option B: Manual Deployment**

If automatic deployment fails, do this manually on the **remote server**:

```bash
# SSH into your remote server
ssh user@192.168.1.100

# Create SSH directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh

# Add public key (paste the key you copied from UI)
echo "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAI... borgscale@myhost" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Set correct permissions
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Exit
exit
```

---

### Step 3: Test SSH Connection

Before creating a repository, verify the SSH connection works:

1. In **SSH Keys** tab, find your key
2. Click **"Test Connection"**
3. Enter remote server details:
   - Hostname: `192.168.1.100`
   - Port: `22`
   - Username: `backupuser`

4. If successful, you'll see: ✅ **"Connection successful!"**

---

### Step 4: Ensure Remote Server is Ready

**Good news:** You don't need to create directories manually! Borg automatically creates the repository directory when you initialize it.

**What you DO need on the remote server:**

1. **Borg installed**
2. **Write permissions** to the parent directory

**Check and prepare the remote server:**

```bash
# SSH into remote server
ssh backupuser@192.168.1.100

# 1. Ensure Borg is installed
borg --version
# If not installed: sudo apt install borgbackup

# 2. (Optional) Create a parent directory if you want to organize repos
#    Borg will create the actual repo directory automatically
mkdir -p ~/borg-backups  # Optional: just for organization

# 3. Verify you have write permissions
touch ~/borg-backups/test && rm ~/borg-backups/test && echo "Permissions OK"

# Exit
exit
```

**Note:** You can skip creating directories - just ensure Borg is installed and you have write access to your home directory or wherever you plan to store repos.

---

### Step 5: Create SSH Repository in BorgScale

Now create a repository that uses SSH to store data remotely.

1. **Navigate to Repositories**
   Click **"Repositories"** in the sidebar

2. **Click "Create Repository"**

3. **Fill in Repository Details:**

   | Field | Example Value | Description |
   |-------|---------------|-------------|
   | **Repository Name** | `offsite-backup` | Friendly name |
   | **Repository Path** | `backupuser@192.168.1.100:borg-backups/myrepo` | SSH format: `user@host:path` |
   | **SSH Key** | `backup-server-key` | Select the key you created earlier |
   | **Encryption Mode** | `repokey-blake2` | Recommended |
   | **Passphrase** | `your-strong-password-456` | **Store safely!** |

   **SSH Path Format:**
   ```
   username@hostname:/absolute/path
   username@hostname:relative/path
   user@example.com:/home/user/backups/repo
   user@192.168.1.100:borg-backups/data
   ```

4. **Configure Compression** (Optional)
   - **Over Fast Network**: `lz4` (fast)
   - **Over Slow Network**: `zstd,3` (more compression = less data transferred)

5. **Add Source Paths**
   What to backup (same as local backups):
   ```
   /local/home/user/Documents
   /local/var/www/html
   /local/etc/nginx
   ```

6. **Click "Create Repository"**

7. **Success!**
   Repository is now active and ready for backups.

---

### Step 6: Run Your First SSH Backup

The process is **identical to local backups**:

1. **Navigate to Backup Tab**
2. **Select your SSH repository** (`offsite-backup`)
3. **Optional: Add exclude patterns**
4. **Click "Start Backup"**
5. **Watch real-time progress**

**Note:** SSH backups may be slower than local backups due to network speed, but Borg's deduplication minimizes data transfer after the first backup.

---

## Commonalities Between Local and SSH Backups

Both methods share the same workflow after repository creation:

### 1. **Backup Process** (Identical)
- Select repository
- Add exclude patterns
- Start backup
- Monitor progress
- View completion statistics

### 2. **Archive Management** (Identical)
- Browse backups in **Archives** tab
- View archive contents
- Restore files
- Delete old archives

### 3. **Scheduling** (Identical)
- Create scheduled jobs in **Schedule** tab
- Set cron expressions (daily, weekly, etc.)
- Monitor execution history

### 4. **Monitoring** (Identical)
- View backup history
- Download logs
- Check repository statistics

---

## Running Your First Backup

Regardless of method (local or SSH), the backup process is the same:

### Using the Backup Tab (Manual Backup)

1. **Go to Backup Tab**
2. **Select Repository** from dropdown
3. **(Optional) Add Exclude Patterns:**
   ```
   **/.git
   **/node_modules
   **/__pycache__
   **/*.tmp
   **/*.log
   ```

4. **Click "Start Backup"**
5. **Monitor Progress:**
   - Current file being processed
   - Files processed
   - Original size vs compressed vs deduplicated
   - Backup speed and ETA

6. **Completion:**
   - View summary statistics
   - Download logs if needed

---

## Scheduling Automated Backups

Set up automated backups to run on a schedule:

### Step 1: Navigate to Schedule Tab

Click **"Schedule"** in the sidebar.

### Step 2: Create Scheduled Job

1. Click **"Create Job"**

2. Fill in details:

   | Field | Example | Description |
   |-------|---------|-------------|
   | **Job Name** | `Daily Documents Backup` | Descriptive name |
   | **Repository** | `my-laptop-backup` | Select your repository |
   | **Schedule** | `0 2 * * *` | Cron expression (2 AM daily) |
   | **Description** | `Backup documents every night` | Optional notes |
   | **Enabled** | ✅ | Start immediately |

3. **Use Preset Schedules:**
   Click the clock icon (⏰) to choose from presets:
   - Every 5 minutes
   - Every hour
   - Daily at 2 AM
   - Weekly on Sunday
   - Monthly on 1st

4. **Click "Create Job"**

### Step 3: Monitor Scheduled Jobs

- View **Next Run** time
- See **Last Run** status
- Check **Backup History** for execution logs

### Step 4: View Running Jobs

When a scheduled backup is running, you'll see it in the **"Running Scheduled Backups"** section with real-time progress.

---

## Restoring from Backups

### Step 1: Browse Archives

1. **Navigate to Archives Tab**
2. **Select Repository**
3. **View list of backups** (sorted by date)

### Step 2: Browse Archive Contents

1. Click **"Browse"** on any archive
2. Navigate through directories
3. Search for specific files

### Step 3: Extract Files

1. Select files/directories to restore
2. Click **"Extract Selected"**
3. Choose destination:
   - **Local**: `/local/home/user/restored-files`
   - **SSH**: Restore to remote server

4. Click **"Start Restore"**
5. Monitor progress

**🎉 Files restored!**

You can also [mount an archive as a read-only filesystem](mounting) for direct filesystem-style access (e.g. from the host or via `docker exec`), useful when you need to browse or copy many files without using the in-app browser.

---

## Managing Job History

### Viewing Job History

All completed jobs (backups, restores, checks, compacts, prunes) are stored in the system and can be viewed in:

- **Backup Tab** - Recent backup jobs
- **Activity Tab** - All job types with filtering
- **Schedule Tab** - Execution history for scheduled jobs

Each job entry shows:
- Job ID and type
- Status (success, failed, cancelled)
- Start/end time and duration
- Log files (view or download)
- Error details (if failed)

### Deleting Job Entries (Admin Only)

{: .warning }
> **Admin Access Required:** Only administrator users can delete job entries. This feature is restricted to prevent accidental data loss.

**When to delete job entries:**
- Clean up test/failed backups
- Remove old job history
- Manage database size
- Remove sensitive log information

**What gets deleted:**
- ✅ Job entry from database
- ✅ Associated log files from disk
- ✅ All job metadata

{: .note }
> **Cannot be undone:** Deletion is permanent. Job history and logs cannot be recovered after deletion.

**How to delete a job:**

1. **Navigate to any job list** (Backup, Activity, or Schedule tab)
2. **Find the completed/failed job** you want to delete
3. **Click the trash icon (🗑️)** in the actions column
4. **Review the warning dialog**
5. **Click "Delete Permanently"** to confirm

**Restrictions:**
- ❌ Cannot delete running jobs - must cancel or wait for completion
- ✅ Can delete pending jobs - useful for cleaning up stuck jobs
- ❌ Non-admin users cannot see delete button
- ❌ API returns 403 Forbidden if non-admin attempts deletion

**Example workflow:**
```
1. Admin user logs in
2. Goes to Activity tab
3. Filters for "Failed" jobs
4. Clicks trash icon on old failed job
5. Confirms deletion in dialog
6. Job removed from all lists
```

## Best Practices

### Security Considerations

1. **⚠️ Restrict Volume Mounts (Critical)** - Never use `/:/local:rw` in production. Mount only the specific directories you need:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     # ✅ Recommended: Specific directories only
     - /home/user/documents:/local:ro          # Backup source (read-only)
     - /mnt/backup-drive:/local/backup:rw      # Backup destination (read-write)

     # ❌ NEVER in production:
     # - /:/local:rw  # Exposes entire filesystem - testing only!
   ```

2. **Use Read-Only Mounts for Sources** - Always mount backup sources as `:ro` to prevent accidental modifications or ransomware attacks

3. **Run as Non-Root User** - Set `PUID` and `PGID` to match your host user (not root) to avoid permission issues

4. **Audit Volume Mounts** - Before deploying to production, document and review every mounted directory

5. **Keep Software Updated** - Regularly update to the latest version for security patches and bug fixes

6. **Use Strong Passphrases** - Generate random passphrases (20+ characters) for both repository encryption and SSH keys

7. **Enable Notifications** - Configure alerts for backup failures and errors to catch issues early

8. **Test Restore Process** - Verify you can actually restore from backups before disaster strikes

See [Security Guide](security) for comprehensive security recommendations.

### For Local Backups

1. **Use external storage** - Don't backup to the same drive as your data
2. **Test restores regularly** - Backups are useless if you can't restore
3. **Consider off-site copies** - Add an SSH backup for critical data
4. **Monitor disk space** - Set up pruning/retention policies
5. **Restrict container access** - Mount only necessary directories (see Security Considerations above)

### For SSH Backups

1. **Use strong passphrases** - Both for SSH keys and repository encryption
2. **Keep SSH keys secure** - Download and store private keys safely
3. **Test connectivity first** - Use "Test Connection" before creating repositories
4. **Use compression** - Saves bandwidth over slow connections
5. **Dedicated backup user** - Create a separate SSH user on remote server

### General

1. **Never lose your passphrase** - Write it down, use a password manager
2. **Schedule backups during off-hours** - Reduces impact on system performance
3. **Use exclude patterns** - Don't backup cache, logs, or temporary files
4. **Monitor backup jobs** - Check logs regularly for errors
5. **Prune old archives** - Set retention policies to manage storage

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Permission denied" when creating repository

**Cause:** Docker user doesn't have write access to storage location.

**Solution:** Set `PUID`/`PGID` in docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
environment:
  - PUID=1000  # Your user ID (run: id -u)
  - PGID=1000  # Your group ID (run: id -g)
```

Restart container: `docker compose down && docker compose up -d`

---

#### SSH connection fails

**Causes:**
1. Public key not deployed correctly
2. Wrong hostname/port/username
3. Firewall blocking SSH
4. Remote server doesn't have Borg installed

**Solutions:**
1. Use **"Test Connection"** to diagnose
2. Verify `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on remote server
3. Check firewall rules: `sudo ufw allow 22/tcp`
4. Install Borg: `sudo apt install borgbackup`

---

#### Backup is very slow

**For Local:**
- Check disk I/O performance
- Reduce compression level
- Exclude unnecessary files

**For SSH:**
- Use faster compression (`lz4` or `none`)
- Check network speed
- Consider initial backup over LAN, then move to remote location

---

#### "Repository not found" error

**Cause:** Path is incorrect or repository wasn't created successfully.

**Solution:**
1. Verify path format:
   - Local: `/local/mnt/usb-drive/backups/repo`
   - SSH: `user@host:backups/repo`

2. Check repository exists:
   ```bash
   # For local
   docker exec borg-web-ui ls -la /local/mnt/usb-drive/backups

   # For SSH
   ssh user@host ls -la ~/backups
   ```

3. Re-create repository if needed

## Summary

### Local Backups in 3 Easy Steps:
1. **Ensure storage is accessible** (USB drive, NAS mount, etc.) with write permissions
2. **Create repository** in UI using `/local/path/to/repo` - Borg auto-creates the directory!
3. **Run backup** - no SSH key needed!

### SSH Backups in 6 Easy Steps:
1. **Generate SSH key** in UI (one click)
2. **Deploy public key** to remote server (automatic or manual)
3. **Test connection** (verify it works)
4. **Ensure Borg is installed** on remote server
5. **Create repository** in UI using `user@host:path` - Borg auto-creates the directory!
6. **Run backup**

**The difference?** Just the SSH key setup. Everything else is identical!

**Pro tip:** Borg automatically creates repository directories when you initialize them - no manual `mkdir` needed!
