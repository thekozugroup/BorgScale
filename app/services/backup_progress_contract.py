"""Versioned backup progress contracts for UI-facing API payloads.

This module is the backend source of truth for which backup progress fields
are supported per Borg major version.

Observed contract in the live `borgscale-web-dev` Borg 2 environment:
- Running `archive_progress` emits: `original_size`, `nfiles`, `path`,
  `hashing_time`, `chunking_time`, `files_stats`, `finished`
- Running `archive_progress` does not emit: `compressed_size`,
  `deduplicated_size`
- `borg2 info --json` for a completed archive exposes `stats.original_size`
  and `stats.nfiles`, but not machine-readable compressed or deduplicated sizes
  in this environment

Because of that, Borg 2 should not advertise `compressed_size` or
`deduplicated_size` in UI progress payloads until the backend has a verified
machine-readable source for them.
